# CSS SASS powerup workshop

## How to install SASS in React

1. `npm install node-sass@4.14.1`  (the latest version 5.0 has a known conflict with React so must use this version for now)


2. Then change `index.css` and `App.css` to `index.scss` `App.scss`

3. In both `index.js` and `App.js` change the import statement from `css to scss` 
`import './index.scss'`
`import './App.scss'`

4. run `npm start or yarn start` 
Should now load with no issues with spinning react icon as before. 

You know have activated SASS in your React app! 


## What is SASS and why use it?

Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
Sass is an extension to CSS
Sass is a CSS pre-processor
Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
1. Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time. You can nest css. 
2. You can use variables
3. Better performance as you will essentially only be loading one css file in your app
4. You can also create whats called mixins which are almost like functions and makes css almost into a programming language by making dynamic changes. 
5. plus much much MORE ! ðŸ˜ƒ

You can actually use a .sass file or .scss file for SASS but I would use scss as you can just use the same syntax as normal css whereas sass is different syntax.
